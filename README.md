rep0st
======
rep0st, the reverse image search for [pr0gramm](https://pr0gramm.com). Available at [rep0st.rene8888.at](https://rep0st.rene8888.at/).

# Documentation
* [API](docs/api): Documentation of the rep0st API.

## Architecture
The application unnecessarily contains a home brew framework using [Injector](https://injector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
It builds upon [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as an ORM Mapper with MariaDB as a backing database,
[Cheroot](https://pypi.org/project/cheroot/) as a WSGI server and some custom DI stuff to glue it all together. On top
of that OpenCV is used for image processing, Elasticsearch with the [Elastiknn](https://github.com/alexklibisz/elastiknn)
plugin for indexing the features. Metrics are exported in the Prometheus format on the `/metricz` endpoints.

There is no technical reason for there being a custom framework. The author was just very bored and wanted to build
one.

## Running the application
Please run all commands from in the project root directory.

### Required software
- Docker and Docker Compose
- pyenv and pipenv

### Setup MariaDB and Elasticsearch
Start MariaDB and Elasticsearch with the correct versions locally.
```shell
docker-compose -p rep0st -f deployment/docker-compose.base.yml build
docker-compose -p rep0st -f deployment/docker-compose.base.yml up -d
```
See deployment/README.md for more info on how to run the application only
using docker and to see the settings that are used.

### Setup the Python development environment
#### Download dependencies
```shell
pipenv install --dev
```

#### Run parts of the application
The following steps should be done at least once to get the minimal state into the database
to be able to only run parts of it for development.

#### Post update job
Run the update job once and fill the database with the first 500 posts.  
Note: The application won't close after the oneshot job finished. It can
be terminated by sending a SIGINT.
```shell
pipenv run python -m rep0st.job.update_posts_job \
  --environment=DEVELOPMENT \
  --rep0st_database_uri="mysql+cymysql://rep0st:pw@localhost/rep0st?charset=utf8mb4" \
  --pr0gramm_api_user=${PR0GRAMM_API_USER?} \
  --pr0gramm_api_password=${PR0GRAMM_API_PASSWORD?} \
  --rep0st_media_path=./data/ \
  --pr0gramm_api_limit_id_to=500 \
  --rep0st_update_posts_job_schedule=oneshot
```

#### Post features job
Run the update job once and calculate features and fill the Elasticsearch index to be able to
perform lookups.
Note: The application won't close after the oneshot job finished. It can
be terminated by sending a SIGINT.
```shell
pipenv run python -m rep0st.job.update_features_job \
  --environment=DEVELOPMENT \
  --rep0st_database_uri="mysql+cymysql://rep0st:pw@localhost/rep0st?charset=utf8mb4" \
  --rep0st_media_path=./data/ \
  --rep0st_update_features_job_schedule=oneshot
```

#### Web
This runs the user facing web application serving the page, API and processing lookups.
```shell
pipenv run python -m rep0st.web \
  --environment=DEVELOPMENT \
  --rep0st_database_uri="mysql+cymysql://rep0st:pw@localhost/rep0st?charset=utf8mb4"
```
